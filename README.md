## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS extension language
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- I learned a new technology (Sass), and was able to implement it in this project. I covered the following topics:
    - variables
    - mixins
    - functions
    - partials
- How to use an HTML element (in this case, radio buttons), to capture user choices.
- I also learned how to grab the user choice with JavaScript and display it in the DOM. 

### Continued development

- This was my first time working with Sass, and I would like to use it in more projects to cement my understanding of the technology.
- I would like to work on more interactive projects to improve my JavaScript skills.

### Useful resources

- [Sass in 2 hours - by freeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a5j7KoflTs&t=6243s) - This tutorial got me started with Sass. It provided enough information for me to use Sass for the first time.
- [Radio button without the dot](https://codepen.io/jacobberglund/pen/mdPEza) - This codepen helped me style the radio buttons for ratings, and use them without the circle/dot.
- [How to get value of selected radio button using JavaScript](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-get-value-of-selected-radio-button-using-javascript/) - This tutorial helped me with adding functionality to the component.
